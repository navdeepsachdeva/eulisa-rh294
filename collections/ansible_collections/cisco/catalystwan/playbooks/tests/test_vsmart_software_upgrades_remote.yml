# Helper playbooks to test modules and flows while developing them
# It assumes that controllers are <20.13 version and Edge are <17.13 version
# Tested operations:


# --- Remote image upload --- #
# Upload viptela-20.13.1-x86_64.tar.gz

# --- vSmart upgrade operations --- #
# 1. Install viptela-20.13.1-x86_64.tar.gz - with reboot
# 2. Verify that activated version appears as current version and old version in available files
# 3. Set default software operation
# 4. Verify that default version set correctly
# 5. Try to downgrade by activating lower version
# 6. Verify that installed version appears as current version

# --- Post test operations - vSmart upgrade to higher version --- #
# Activate software 20.13.1 on all vSmart devices
